//HOW TO USE THIS ASSET//
/////////////////////////

Hello, fellow game developer! Thank you for downloading Will's Magic Pixel Particle Effects. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

---TIPS AND TRICKS---

- In the main folder, you'll see 1 folder for each animation. I've tried to name them as descriptively as I can!

- In each animation folder, you'll find a "frames" folder. This is where the individual frames of the animation are.
	NOTE: Some frames are blank! Feel free to remove them if you want, but they're not hurting anything. ;)
	      (This is a by-product of the way the animations were created.)

- In each animation folder, you'll also find a spritesheet. This is all the individual frames packed into one image. The accompanying text file is metadata describing where each frame is on the spritesheet.
The metadata format is:
(frame name) = x y width height

- If you'd like to make your own particle systems, I've also included all the basic particles I used to create these effects. You can find them in the raw_particles folder, and they have their own spritesheet.

---FRAME DURATIONS---

Each animation has specific durations for each frame, measured in milliseconds.
Fortunately, this asset pack is easy: They're all 60 FPS animations! That means 16.67 milliseconds per frame.
